## Installing Visual Studio Code Snippets

Download this repo to your `TeamCharles` directory or download `classDocSnippet.snippet` and `methodDocSnippet.snippet` to your machine.

In Visual Studio, click `Tools` -> `Code Snippets Manager`. 

Select `CSharp` as the language.

Select the `My Code Snippets` directory as the location (or choose your preferred folder for custom code snippets).

Click `Import` and navigate to the `classDocSnippet.snippet` file. Repeat this and import the `methodDocSnippet.snippet` file as well.

When you select `OK` after importing the snippets, you are now able to use the following commands to run the snippets:
